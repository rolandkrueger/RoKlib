<h1>Augmented Typing</h1>
<p>The augmented typing text fields allow you to enter a larger
range of characters than is usually possible with a normal keyboard. In
this demo, you can enter phonetics, German umlauts or French special
characters.</p>
<p>The augmented text field lets you type your characters as usual.
Every time that you type in a letter that is similar to one of the
special characters offered by the text field, a drop down field pops up
where you can select this special character either with the mouse or
with the arrow keys.</p>
<p>For example, you can enter the German umlaut '&uuml;' by typing a
'u' and then selecting the '&uuml;' from the drop down list.</p>
<p>Note that the mapping of characters on special characters is done
entirely in code. This is not done by changing the keyboard layout of
the operating system.</p>
