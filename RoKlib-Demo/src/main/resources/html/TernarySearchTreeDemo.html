<h1>Ternary Search Tree</h1>

<p>This page demonstrates the two main features of a ternary search
tree: prefix matching and spell checking. As an example, the complete
English dictionary with about 115,000 entries is loaded into this data
structure.</p>

<p>You can do prefix matching and spell checking both with a case
sensitive and a case insensitive version of the search tree. On the
left, you can enter a search string for the case sensitive map, while
search terms for case insensitive searching is entered on the left. The
list containing your search result will be updated as you type. Below,
you see how many entries the list does contain together with the
information about the duration of the most recent filtering process
given in milliseconds.</p>

<p>Note that no matter how you mix upper and lower case in your
search terms for the case insensitive search tree, you will always get
the original entries as a result. Your mixed case search terms are
passed to the search tree's query methods unaltered, i.e. they need not
be changed to lower or upper case beforehand.</p>

<p>The spell checking search mode will find all entries in the
search tree which are similar to the term you have entered. Similar in
this case means that at most two characters may be different between two
matching entries and they are allowed to differ at most two characters
in length.</p>

<p>For comparison, you can also perform the prefix matching by using
the standard String.startsWith() operation. Matching keys are then
identified by iterating over all keys in the dictionary set and calling
the startsWith() method on them. If you check the checkbox to use this
approach, you'll see that the prefix matching will take significantly
more time. As opposed to the ternary search tree, the search operation
does not get faster the longer the search prefix becomes but instead
performs equally bad.</p>
