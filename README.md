For Those About To RoK

- - - - - 
RoKlib is a general purpose library written in Java. I use this library to put all general utility code from my other projects into one place. Some of its prominent features are an implementation class of a Ternary Search Tree hash map, an object-oriented abstraction of logical expressions, and a framework for mapping the action URLs of a web application on command objects. RoKlib uses Apache Maven as build tool.
